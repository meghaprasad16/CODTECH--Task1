## Overview of the Project
## Project: LINEAR REGRESSION ON HOUSING PRICES
### Objective
Implement linear regression to predict housing prices based on features like square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. 
### Key Activities
For developing a sentiment analysis model to classify movie reviews as positive or negative, the key activities include:
Data Preparation:
Loading the Dataset: Import the dataset containing movie reviews and their associated sentiments.
Text Preprocessing: Clean the text data by removing punctuation, converting text to lowercase, removing stop words, and tokenizing the text.

Feature Engineering:
Vectorization: Convert the textual data into numerical format using techniques like Bag of Words (BoW), TF-IDF, or Word Embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).

Model Selection:
Choose an Algorithm: Select a machine learning model suitable for text classification, such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), or even a deep learning model like an LSTM or BERT.
Train the Model: Train the selected model on the preprocessed and vectorized data.

Model Evaluation:
Testing: Evaluate the model on a separate test dataset using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Confusion Matrix: Analyze the confusion matrix to understand the true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
Model Tuning:

Hyperparameter Tuning: Adjust model parameters to improve performance, potentially using techniques like Grid Search or Random Search.
Cross-Validation: Implement cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness.

Deployment:
Save the Model: Serialize the trained model using joblib or pickle for later use.
Integration: Deploy the model in a web application or service where it can be used to classify new movie reviews as positive or negative.

Monitoring & Maintenance:
Model Performance: Continuously monitor the modelâ€™s performance in a production environment.
Model Updates: Periodically update the model with new data to maintain accuracy over time.

### Technologies Used
1. Python
The primary programming language used to implement the sentiment analysis model.
2. Pandas
Pandas is used for loading and handling the dataset (pd.read_csv), as well as for basic data manipulation tasks.
3. Scikit-learn
Train-Test Split: The train_test_split function is used to split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Linear Regression
Model Evaluation: Functions like mean_squared_error and r2_score were mentioned for evaluation in the linear regression.
4. Numpy
